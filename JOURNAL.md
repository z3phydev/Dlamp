for now. Its going to be mostly made out of 25mm dowels. I'll add the 3D printed connecters soon.  

## 1/18/2026 - Finished Modeling - About 2 Hours  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

All 3D printed parts now done. The 3D printed diffeser is 4mm because it lets the right amount of light through. The top is at 15 degrees from flat because I decided it looked right.
Now for picking parts and sorting out the wiring.

Then started work on the BOM which is always something I underestamite the time of. First I looked on amazon then looked on aliepress to see if they were there, they were. Ebay seemed to sell the best led strips for a good price.

Then made the repo, uploaded all the files and made a readme.
